# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# SENTRY

SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# CLERK

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# FIREBASE

FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxxxxx
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxxxxxx
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxxxxxx
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxxxxx
